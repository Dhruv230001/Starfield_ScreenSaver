## Description: The "Starfield Screensaver" project creates a mesmerizing animated starfield effect, enhancing the ambiance of digital environments and providing a visually captivating experience relevant to media and digital arts.

##Features: 
-Particle Animation: Stars are generated and animated across the screen.Utilizes Pygame library to create and animate particle objects representing stars.
-Mouse Interaction: Stars react to mouse movement, creating dynamic patterns as they avoid the cursor.
-Implements mouse position tracking to influence star movement, enhancing interactivity.

## Challenges:
-Understanding Particle Systems: Exploring concepts of particle generation and animation for visually appealing effects.
-Pygame Integration: Learning to effectively utilize the Pygame library for graphics rendering and user interaction.
-Optimization: Ensuring smooth performance and efficient rendering, especially with a large number of particles.

## Outcomes
-Ideal Outcome:
The ideal outcome is a visually stunning screensaver with smoothly animated stars that react dynamically to mouse movements, creating an immersive digital experience.

-Minimal Viable Outcome:
A basic functioning screensaver with animated stars and mouse interaction, demonstrating the core concept and providing an engaging visual display.
